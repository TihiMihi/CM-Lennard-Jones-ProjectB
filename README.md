## The Lennard Jones Potential on Argon particles 

Project B: Lennard Jones simulation of Argon
particles moving in a double well potential using
a velocity Verlet time integration.

Produces trajectory file of N particles interacting
via the Lennard Jones potential at a given density
and temperature.

Produces plots of the energies of the system
and the mean distribution as functions of time
and the average radial distribution function.
